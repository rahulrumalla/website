# What I'm working on

<div class="company-section current">

### Safe Labs

<span class="role-badge">CEO</span> <span class="years">2024 - Present</span>

Safe Labs is the product company behind <a href="https://app.safe.global" target="_blank">Safe Wallet</a> and Safe Smart Accounts, the most widely adopted multisig-based smart account architecture for secure onchain ownership. Safe is used for treasury custody and onchain operations by organizations and individuals, securing over <span class="stat-highlight">100 billion dollars</span> in assets and processing more than <span class="stat-highlight">1.4 trillion dollars</span> in transaction volume.

The project is rooted in cypherpunk values of self-sovereignty, user control, and open systems. My work at Safe focuses on extending those principles into what I call a Cypherprise model. This means building infrastructure that preserves user ownership while meeting the reliability, security, and usability expectations of real organizations operating at scale.

### Otterspace

<span class="role-badge">Co-founder, CTO</span> <span class="years">2022 - 2024</span>

I co-founded Otterspace to explore how reputation in digital communities could be owned by individuals rather than platforms. We built a system of badges and credentials using non-transferable NFTs, allowing people to carry their identity and contributions across networks. As part of this work, I co-authored EIP-4973, introducing account-bound tokens. Otterspace was adopted by hundreds of DAOs and communities to track reputation and experiment with governance models beyond token-weighted voting.

### SoundCloud

<span class="role-badge">Director</span> <span class="years">2018 - 2021</span>

I joined SoundCloud to work on the problem of artist independence and digital ownership at global scale. I built and led the Integrations group from scratch, overseeing strategy and development across audio playback and streaming, device integrations, product partnerships, the developer ecosystem, and the DJ Partner Program. At the time, SoundCloud hosted hundreds of millions of tracks from tens of millions of creators and served a global audience of listeners.

### Paperchain

<span class="role-badge">Co-founder, CTO</span> <span class="years">2017 - 2019</span>

I co-founded Paperchain to address a long-standing problem in the music industry: opaque and delayed royalty systems. The company grew out of my academic thesis at Berklee, Blackbox Royalties, which explored how creators lose control and visibility over their earnings. This work led me to Web3, where we became one of the first teams to tokenize music royalties to provide faster liquidity to independent artists and labels.
