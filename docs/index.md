  text: "Building systems people can truly own"
  tagline: "I’ve spent my career building systems that people can truly own and trust. My work spans self-custody, financial infrastructure, and large-scale platforms that shape how value moves, is governed, and is created.


Today, I’m CEO of Safe Labs, building core infrastructure for the onchain economy.


Previously, I helped shape how hundreds of millions of people discover, distribute, and monetize music at SoundCloud, and I’ve founded startups across Web3 and the creator ecosystem."
