# About

Hi! Rahul here and I'm a creator, strategist, and builder with over 15 years of experience across Web3 and music industries. As a founder and long-time Ethereum community member, I developed a unique expertise in designing at-scale solutions that bridge the gap between emerging technology and real-world applications. With a deep passion for innovation, I thrive on developing impactful products and leading teams to tackle complex challenges. A thinker and leader at heart, I'm driven by the mission to shape the future of Web3 and create experiences that push boundaries and redefine whatâ€™s possible.

I'm a frequent [presenter](/talks) at conferences within the Music and Web3 industries, talking about things I learn in these fields.
