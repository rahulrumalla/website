# Writing

I write about building systems that last. My work focuses on product strategy, organizational design, and the philosophy of high-stakes infrastructure, especially in environments where failure is costly and trust must be engineered. Much of my writing explores how complex systems become usable products, how teams make decisions under uncertainty, and how values translate into real-world tradeoffs.

### Topics I write about

- Strategic models for building and scaling products
- Product philosophy
- Self-custody UX and secure defaults
- Security as a product, not a feature
- Leadership and organizational design for high-stakes engineering teams

### How I Think

My writing draws on systems thinkers like Naval Ravikant and Paul Graham, product and strategy frameworks from Lenny Ratchinsky, Reforge, and The Pragmatic Engineer, and leadership perspectives from Brene Brown, Reid Hoffman, and Ben Horowitz. I use these as tools, not doctrines, to reason about real systems, real organizations, and real tradeoffs.
