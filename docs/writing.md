# Writing

I write about product strategy, leadership, and the systems behind large-scale digital infrastructure. Much of my work explores how teams make <span class="key-term">decisions under uncertainty</span>, how technical primitives become usable products, and how values are expressed through design.

My focus is on long-term thinking rather than tactics, and on building systems that remain legible, reliable, and trustworthy as they scale.

### Topics I write about

- Strategic models for building and scaling products
- Leadership and organizational design
- Product philosophy
- Self-custody UX and secure defaults
