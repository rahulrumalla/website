This talk covered the basics of Blockchain, Smart Contracts & the Ethereum ecosystem followed by the demo of using nuxt-box as part of the developer toolkit necessary to build decentralized applications using VueJs and Nuxt. Nuxt-box is a boilerplate for decentralized applications using VueJS, NuxtJS and the Truffle framework. This is an open-source project led by Paperchain, where we're looking to open source more things in VueJS + Ethereum.
