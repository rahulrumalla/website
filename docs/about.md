# About

<div class="drop-cap-paragraph">

I am Rahul Rumalla, a CEO and builder working on systems that people can actually own and trust. My work spans <span class="key-term">self-custody</span>, financial infrastructure, and large-scale platforms, with a focus on product strategy and how complex technical systems become reliable, usable products.

</div>

I've spent my career building in high-stakes environments where mistakes are expensive. In these contexts, security, reliability, and user trust are not features. They determine whether a product should exist at all. As <span class="key-term">Web3 infrastructure</span> moves from early adopters to mainstream and institutional use, the bar changes. What matters is not just innovation, but predictability, resilience, and product experiences that reduce irreversible mistakes.

How do we give people real control over valuable digital assets without requiring them to be experts?

</div>

Today, I'm CEO of <span class="key-term">Safe Labs</span>, building core self-custody infrastructure for the onchain economy. My focus is on translating cryptographic primitives into products that are secure by default, operationally resilient, and usable by real organizations and real people.
